// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

a%2 = 0 
a%2 = 1 

num1%2= remainder
print remainder 

ask for number 
divide the number by 2
Print on the screen the remainder 

If remainder = 0, print "even"
If remainder = 1, print "odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo-code that will perform the following.    

smallest = 100
largest = -100

a + b + c + d + e = sum / 5
num1 + num2 + num3 + num 4 + num5 = sum/5
sum/5 = average of the five numbers 

Ask for five numbers
add the five numbers together
divide the sum of the five numbers by 5 
print average 
if number  < smallest, update the smallest number 
smallest = number 

if number is > largest, update the largest number 
largest = number

print "The smallest number is:" (minimum)
print "The largest number is:" (maximum)

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
